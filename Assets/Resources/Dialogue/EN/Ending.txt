At last . . . I have defeated the evil of the Wizard. &Ali&
And I've freed all the world's people! &Ali&
Let's get married, and have an awesome traditional nuclear family!
Fuck yeah! &Ali&
Hey, remember that religious motif we dropped on you mid-game?
That's right . . . this has been a Christian Game all along! &Jesus&
All the good guys who died? They're in heaven now. &Jesus&
Fuck yeah! They've got hella beans in heaven! &Lee&
The Wizard and his army? They're suffering for eternity, of course. &Jesus&
Thanks for playing! Don't forget to pray every day! &Ali&
Maybe you could save the world too! &Ali&
