I bet you guys would love some really cool exposition right about now. &Elder&
Nope &Lee&
Once upon a time, &Elder&
Everything got Nuked. &Elder&

Now there is just desert, and ruin. &Elder&
This is The Wizard. &Elder&
He's the bad guy (pretend I put in Billie Eilish lol) &Elder&
He utters spells in an ancient, forgotten language. &Elder&
"Chinga Tu Puta Madre" &Mago&#A9A900FF&
His Goal Is Simple: &Elder&
To conquer the Earth. &Elder&
Or Destroy it. &Elder&
And for some reason he needs a golden sword and human brain? &Elder&
Honestly, it's really not clear. &Elder&
(Don't worry about the plot it wasn't that well thought out)
