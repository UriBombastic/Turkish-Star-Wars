I'm tired of being the sidekick. I'm going to take these weapons to the Elder, and find out how to beat the Wizard. &Lee&
If the world gets destroyed, all the sexy women die with it. &Lee&

Elder, please show me how to use these legendary weapons. &Lee&
Sure. Let me see them? &Elder&

FOOL! I AM ACTUALLY THE WIZARD! &Mago&#A9A900FF&

GIVE THAT BACK! &Lee&

Now what? &Ali&

LISTEN UP HUMANS! YOUR TIME HAS COME! &Mago&#A9A900FF&
NOW THAT I HAVE TOUCHED THE MAGIC SWORD AND GOLDEN BRAIN, I AM INVINCIBLE! &Mago&#A9A900FF&
Fuck. &Lee&

Look! It's the real Elder! I think! &Ali&
I'm going to die. &Elder&
There's only one way to defeat the Wizard now. &Elder&
You have to combine the sword and brain in that forge. &Elder&
It's a risky procedure. You run a chance of destroying them both. &Elder&
Please . . . Save the world . . . &Elder&
*Dies* &Elder&

This. . . this is my fault . . . &Lee&
...And I'm going to fix it! &Lee&
LEE, NO! &Ali&
CHINGA TU PUTA MADRE!!! &Mago&#A9A900FF&
