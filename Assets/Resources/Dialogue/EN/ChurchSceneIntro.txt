I'm glad you made it out alive. What happened to your partner? &Elder&
I'm not sure. &Ali&
But I laid waste to most of the Wizard's minions, including that big guy. He'll be fine. &Ali&
Very well. Are you ready for the next part of your quest? &Elder&
Duh lol &Ali&
Very Well. &Elder&
Return to the desert. There, you will find an ancient church. &Elder&
In the backroom, you will find the magic Lightning sword. &Elder&
It is the secret weapon you'll need to defeat the Wizard. &Elder&
Got it. I'm on it. &Ali&
